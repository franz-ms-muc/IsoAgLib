 * This file is part of the "IsoAgLib", an object oriented program library *
 * to serve as a software layer between application specific program and   *
 * communication protocol details. By providing simple function calls for  *
 * jobs like starting a measuring program for a process data value on a    *
 * remote ECU, the main program has not to deal with single CAN telegram   *
 * formatting. This way communication problems between ECU's which use     *
 * this library should be prevented.                                       *
 * Everybody and every company is invited to use this library to make a    *
 * working plug and play standard out of the printed protocol standard.    *

 * The header <i>\<target\>/\<device\>/\<device\>.h</i> performs a name
   mapping between platform specific BIOS / OS function names
   and the function names, the IsoAgLib uses for hardware access.
   In this header only the groups for error codes, global system
   functions and CAN must be adapted to a new platform.
   If a simple name mapping is not possible for a specific
   function, the module targetExtensions can be used to implement
   the needed activity. The implementation of the PC version
   can be used to derive the meaning of the specific function.
